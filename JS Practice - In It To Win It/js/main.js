// //Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

// let threeMovies = ["Shrek", "The Adam Project", "The Matrix"];

// // console.log(threeMovies)

// //Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

// // let firstMovie = threeMovies[0];

// // //Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

// // let howManyMovies = threeMovies.length;
