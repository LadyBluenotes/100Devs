# 100Devs
Some of the work I have done with the #100Devs.

Current work includes some clones of popular websites (Khan Academy, TechCrunch and BBC) utiliing HTML and CSS.

In addition to the HTML and CSS learned, it was applied with JavaScript to create an Ugly Calculator.

Some examples of my JavaScript code using arrays, loops and basic functions take place in the JS practice folders.These were applied just for the console to log or, in some cases, manipulating the DOM.
